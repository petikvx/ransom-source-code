```bash
ptkmwdb() {
    # Prompt the user to enter the search pattern
    echo "Please enter the search pattern (e.g., tag:yara:malware_win_chaos or tag:\"yara:malware_win_chaos\"):"
    read search_pattern

    # If the input doesn't start with "tag:", prepend it
    if [[ ! "$search_pattern" =~ ^tag: ]]; then
        search_pattern="tag:$search_pattern"
    fi

    # Ensure the pattern is properly quoted if it contains a colon after tag:
    if [[ "$search_pattern" =~ ^tag:.*:.* ]] && [[ ! "$search_pattern" =~ ^tag:\".*\"$ ]]; then
        formatted_pattern="\"$search_pattern\""
    else
        formatted_pattern="$search_pattern"
    fi

    # Debugging: Show the formatted pattern
    echo "Using pattern: $formatted_pattern"

    # Execute the mwdb search with the formatted pattern and process all results
    mwdb search "$formatted_pattern" -o short | while read t; do
        # Check if a file or directory containing the hash exists in the current directory and subdirectories
        if ! find . -type f -name "*$t*" -o -type d -name "*$t*" | grep -q .; then
            echo "Downloading $t..."
            mwdb fetch "$t"
        else
            echo "A file or directory containing $t already exists, skipping download."
        fi
    done
}
```

1.  Prompts the user for a search pattern (e.g., tag:yara:malware_win_chaos).
2.  Prepends tag: to the pattern if missing.
3.  Adds quotes around the pattern (e.g., "tag:yara:malware_win_chaos") if it contains a colon after tag: and isnâ€™t already quoted.
4.  Displays the formatted pattern for debugging.
5.  Runs mwdb search with the pattern, retrieving results in short format.
6.  For each result (assumed to be a hash), checks if a file or directory containing that hash exists in the current directory and its subdirectories using find.
7.  Downloads the file with mwdb fetch if no match is found; otherwise, skips it with a message.
