# In-Depth Analysis of a Ransomware's Source Code

As a malware analysis specialist, I’ve examined the provided source code, which appears to be a decompiled version of a ransomware. Ransomware is a type of malicious software that encrypts victims' files and demands payment—typically in cryptocurrency—for a decryption key. My objective is to break down the code, highlight its key features, and provide actionable insights for defense. The analysis is based on the decompiled output from Hex-Rays (version 9.0.0.240925), and I’ll use code snippets to illustrate critical points.

----------

## 1. Identifying the Malware Type

The code exhibits clear hallmarks of **ransomware**, confirmed by the following evidence:

-   **Encryption Functions**: It uses Windows cryptographic APIs, such as:
    
```c
BOOL (__stdcall *CryptAcquireContextW)(HCRYPTPROV *phProv, LPCWSTR szContainer, LPCWSTR szProvider, DWORD dwProvType, DWORD dwFlags);
BOOL (__stdcall *CryptGenRandom)(HCRYPTPROV hProv, DWORD dwLen, BYTE *pbBuffer);
```
    
These functions establish a cryptographic context and generate random data, typically for creating encryption keys.
    
-   **Ransom Note**: A static variable, `Buffer`, contains a message for victims:

```c
const CHAR Buffer[1632] = "We are the Abyss.\r\n\r\nYour company Servers are crypted and your data has been stolen to our servers.\r\n\r\n\r\nGood news for you:\r\n\r\n   1) We can restore your entire system.\r\n   2) We are not interested in publishing your information.\r\n   3) Our motivation is purely financial.\r\n   4) We are open to negotiations.\r\n   5) We are ready to maintain complete confidentiality of this incident.\r\n\r\nLet's explain the further steps in the situation:\r\n\r\n    You can seek help from authorities - unfortunately, this path will not lead to a constructive resolution of the situation. \r\n\tThey will not assist you with decryption, seize your servers for OPsec, and your company's operations will be halted.\r\n\tSubsequently, the date will be disclosed, leading to fines, legal actions, and reputational damage.\r\n    OR\r\n    You initiate negotiations with us, and we reach a mutually beneficial and constructive solution for both parties.\r\n\tYou pay a specified amount and receive the full decryption, support throughout the decryption process, \r\n\tproofs that all information on our servers has been deleted, and a guarantee that it will never resurface, \r\n\tensuring no one learns about this incident.\r\n\r\nTo initiate negotiations, please download the Tor Browser using their official website: https://www.torproject.org/\r\nuse these credentials to enter the Chat for text negotiation: http://jqlcrn2fsfvxlngdq53rqyrwtwfrulup74xyle54bsvo3l2kgpeeijid.onion/x89yk54gGqjJ8ZAduh5dioahO1TXRA\r\nThere will be no bad news for your company after successful negotiations for both sides. But there will be plenty of those bad news if case of failed negotiations, so don";
```
This note confirms the encryption of files and data theft, offering negotiation via the Tor network—a common ransomware tactic.
    
-   **Targeted Disruption**: The code includes lists of services and processes to terminate, a strategy to disable defenses before encryption begins.

----------

## 2. Entry Points

The program’s entry point is likely the `main` function:

```c
int __fastcall main(int argc, const char **argv, const char **envp);
```
While its full implementation isn’t shown, it probably initiates the ransomware’s operations by calling other functions.

Another key function, `sub_14001C9D0`, handles network interactions:

```c
DWORD __fastcall sub_14001C9D0(struct _NETRESOURCEW *a1, __int64 a2);
```
It uses the `_NETRESOURCEW` structure to access network shares, potentially for communication with a command and control (C&C) server or data exfiltration.

----------

## 3. Malicious Capabilities

### a. File Encryption

Encryption is handled by functions like `sub_140017D40`:

```c
__int64 __fastcall sub_140017D40(_OWORD *a1, __m128i *a2, __m128i *a3, size_t a4);
```

This function uses SIMD instructions (__m128i) for efficient, high-speed encryption of large datasets, a hallmark of modern ransomware.

### b. Network Communication

The ransomware communicates via the Tor network, as indicated by the onion URL in the ransom note. Additionally, `sub_14001C9D0` suggests it can interact with network resources, possibly to spread or exfiltrate data.

### c. Disabling Defenses

The malware targets specific services and processes:

-   **Services (off_140009990)**:
    
```c
char *off_140009990[159] = {
  "MSSQLServerADHelper100",
  "SQLAgent$ISARS",
  "WinDefend",
  "MSExchangeIS",
  "BackupExecVSSProvider",
  // ... (more in source)
};
```
    
These include SQL Server, Windows Defender, and backup services.
-   **Processes (off_140009E90)**:
    
```c
wchar_t *off_140009E90[159] = {
  L"360se.exe",
  L"AvastUI.exe",
  L"MsMpEng.exe",
  L"Sqlservr.exe",
  L"VeeamDeploymentSvc.exe",
  // ... (more in source)
};
```    
This list targets antivirus tools and critical applications.

It likely uses APIs like `CreateToolhelp32Snapshot` and `Process32NextW` to enumerate and terminate these targets:

```c
HANDLE (__stdcall *CreateToolhelp32Snapshot)(DWORD dwFlags, DWORD th32ProcessID);
BOOL (__stdcall *Process32NextW)(HANDLE hSnapshot, LPPROCESSENTRY32W lppe);
```
----------

## 4. Evasion Techniques

The ransomware employs several methods to avoid detection:

-   **String Obfuscation**: Names of services and processes are stored in static arrays, potentially decrypted at runtime.
-   **Native APIs**: It uses functions like `SetFileAttributesW` to hide files:
    
```c
BOOL (__stdcall *SetFileAttributesW)(LPCWSTR lpFileName, DWORD dwFileAttributes);
```    
-   **Defense Suppression**: Terminating services like WinDefend disables real-time protection.

----------

## 5. Static Data Insights

-   **Ransom Note (Buffer)**: Highlights a financial motive and negotiation process.
```c
#include <windows.h>

// Ransom note extracted from the provided source code
const CHAR Buffer[1632] = "We are the Abyss.\r\n\r\nYour company Servers are crypted and your data has been stolen to our servers.\r\n\r\n\r\nGood news for you:\r\n\r\n   1) We can restore your entire system.\r\n   2) We are not interested in publishing your information.\r\n   3) Our motivation is purely financial.\r\n   4) We are open to negotiations.\r\n   5) We are ready to maintain complete confidentiality of this incident.\r\n\r\nLet's explain the further steps in the situation:\r\n\r\n    You can seek help from authorities - unfortunately, this path will not lead to a constructive resolution of the situation. \r\n\tThey will not assist you with decryption, seize your servers for OPsec, and your company's operations will be halted.\r\n\tSubsequently, the date will be disclosed, leading to fines, legal actions, and reputational damage.\r\n    OR\r\n    You initiate negotiations with us, and we reach a mutually beneficial and constructive solution for both parties.\r\n\tYou pay a specified amount and receive the full decryption, support throughout the decryption process, \r\n\tproofs that all information on our servers has been deleted, and a guarantee that it will never resurface, \r\n\tensuring no one learns about this incident.\r\n\r\nTo initiate negotiations, please download the Tor Browser using their official website: https://www.torproject.org/\r\nuse these credentials to enter the Chat for text negotiation: http://jqlcrn2fsfvxlngdq53rqyrwtwfrulup74xyle54bsvo3l2kgpeeijid.onion/x89yk54gGqjJ8ZAduh5dioahO1TXRA\r\nThere will be no bad news for your company after successful negotiations for both sides. But there will be plenty of those bad news if case of failed negotiations, so don";

// Hypothetical function to write the ransom note
__int64 __fastcall writeRansomNote(__int64 context, const WCHAR* directory) {
    WCHAR filePath[MAX_PATH];
    HANDLE hFile;
    DWORD bytesWritten;

    // Build the file path (e.g., "C:\\README.txt")
    swprintf(filePath, MAX_PATH, L"%s\\README.txt", directory);

    // Create the file
    hFile = CreateFileW(
        filePath,
        GENERIC_WRITE,
        0,
        NULL,
        CREATE_ALWAYS,
        FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL,
        NULL
    );

    if (hFile == INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE) {
        return GetLastError();
    }

    // Write the ransom note
    WriteFile(
        hFile,
        Buffer,
        sizeof(Buffer) - 1, // Size excluding the null terminator
        &bytesWritten,
        NULL
    );

    CloseHandle(hFile);
    return (bytesWritten == (sizeof(Buffer) - 1)) ? 0 : 1;
}

// Hypothetical entry point
int __fastcall main(int argc, const char **argv, const char **envp) {
    const WCHAR* targetDir = L"C:\\";
    writeRansomNote(0, targetDir);
    return 0;
}
```

-   **Excluded Paths (off_14000C3B0)**:
    
```c
wchar_t *off_14000C3B0[33] = {
    L"Boot",
    L"Windows",
    L"Windows.old",
    L"$Windows.~bt",
    L"$windows.~ws",
    L"windows nt",
    L"msbuild",
    L"microsoft",
    L"perflog",
    L"microsoft.net",
    L"microsoft shared",
    L"common files",
    L"windows defender",
    L"windowspowershell",
    L"windows security",
    L"usoshared",
    L"windowsapp",
    L"windows journal",
    L"windows photo viewer",
    L"$Recycle.Bin",
    L"All Users",
    L"Program Files",
    L"Program Files (x86)",
    L"system volume information",
    L"msocache",
    L"Tor Browser",
    L"Internet Explorer",
    L"Google",
    L"Opera",
    L"Opera Software",
    L"Mozilla",
    L"Mozilla Firefox",
    L"#recycle"
};};
```    
These exclusions keep the system operational to display the ransom note.

## 6. Exploited Vulnerabilities

No specific exploits (e.g., CVEs) are evident, but the ransomware leverages social engineering via the ransom note and targets weaknesses by disabling critical services.

----------

## 7. Persistence Mechanisms

Persistence may be achieved through functions like `sub_14001B650`:

```c
__int64 __fastcall sub_14001B650(LPCWSTR lpExistingFileName, DWORD *a2);
```
This could modify the registry or install services to ensure the malware runs after a reboot.

----------

## 8. Network Communication

Beyond Tor, the ransomware may use SMB or similar protocols via `_NETRESOURCEW` to access network shares, enabling lateral movement or data theft.

----------

## 9. Potential Targets

The targeted services (SQL Server, Exchange) and processes (Veeam, antivirus) suggest a focus on **enterprise environments**, particularly those with databases, email systems, and backups.

----------

## 10. Mitigation Recommendations

To defend against this ransomware:

-   **Patch Systems**: Keep software and OS updated.
-   **Security Tools**: Use antivirus, EDR, and firewalls.
-   **Offline Backups**: Maintain regular, disconnected backups.
-   **User Awareness**: Train staff to recognize phishing and ransomware signs.
-   **Network Segmentation**: Limit spread by isolating critical systems.

----------
